1. Required packages

- matplotlib
- multiprocess [conda often fails to find this]
- scipy
- networkx
- searborn
- pydot [only if you use Graphviz layout at drawing]

2. Installation guide

If you are an Anaconda user, try the following first to install package X1, X2, ...:

    conda install X1 X2 ... -y

and do the following only when Y fails to install:

    pip install -U Y

and then do the following:

    conda update conda -y

This is recommended not to destroying your Anaconda installation.
